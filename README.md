# honor_project

I chose to do a College Management System for my this project because Iâ€™m interested in working with the database system in any field.

I began with implementing a Postgres database and a web-based application that interacts with the database. Then, I used Docker Compose to define and manage the tiers. After that, I pushed it to my online repository on GitHub. Lastly, I used Insomnia to interact with the endpoints.

I chose to use the Django Framework to build my application. Learning Django on my own was very interesting. Honestly, I really struggled at first but the more I learn Django, the more it becomes clear to me how it works little by little.

My overall experience in doing this project is challenging and amazing as well. All of my struggles and hard work paid off in the end. It was awesome to see the progress of my project and hopefully I will be able to add more features into it in the near future.
